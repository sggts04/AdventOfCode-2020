# Advent of Code 2020

[Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles conducted every year in December.](https://adventofcode.com/)

On every day from 1 Dec to 25 Dec, two new puzzles are unlocked at 10:30 am IST with problem difficulty increasing each day.

This is an archive of all my solutions from Advent of Code 2020, I try to solve as fast as I can after the puzzle unlocks at 10:30 am, so expect competitive programming style code than actual good code :)

My Current Stats from Each Day:

Most solutions are in Python since most inputs are string based and string operations are just a lot more easier in python.

`code-1.py` is for the first part of the puzzle and `code-2.py` is for the second part of the puzzle. All codes use stdin instead of reading from a file, so I redirect stdin from input.txt to run the code.

To run a solution:
```bash
$ python code-1.py < input.txt
```
